# Side Quest

## Description

Side Quest is a very intuitive application that makes simple travel plans turned into a game versus everyone. Search, accept, and create real life quests for you and others to take on as you venture around the world. 

If you have a simple family trip planned to go to Hawaii and be on the beach all day, everyday, make it a little more interesting by accepting a quest to jump off the rock at Waimea Bay for 200 Experience Points.

Through using and playing Side Quest you're able to do things you might not ever think of. The quests are created by anyone, allowing others to gain those same experiences for themselves. When you have a trip planned, instead of searching on google for the top tourist attractions, use Side Quest to find the hidden treasures to have a different and even better experience on your travels.

## Contributing

This project was tough for all of us. We looked for help from anywhere we could get it. We searched Google, referenced other repos on GitHub for certain situations, received help from TA's and tutors, and had outside help from a friend.
